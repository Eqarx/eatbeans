# eatbeans.
It is a program
Control Pac-Man to eat all the beans in the maze, while avoiding the goblins as much as possible. Once Pac-Man has eaten the energy pills, he can then turn around and bully the little ghosts for a certain amount of time. It's also worth noting that the left and right exits of the maze are connected, so it's often a good idea to be flexible.
